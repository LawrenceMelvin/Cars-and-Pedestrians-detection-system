# Cars-and-Pedestrians-detection-system
This project is done in python using opencv module(open Computer Vision). In this project I have used a pre-trained cars and pedestrians data, the per-trained data are the data that went through haar cascading algorithm.
The Basic concept of this project is:
1. A video stream is given as input.
2. Then we are changing the colored video to a black and white video(optional).
3. Using the opencv model and the per-trained cars and pedestrians data we can identity the cars and pedestrians.
4. Draw a Rectangle around the identified objects(for human view).
